DevFestMN 2017 Live Firebase Demo

## About
This application is a sample application that shows firebase authentication, firebase database, and firebase deploy.

This was created on Saturday, Feb 4th 2017 at [DevFestMN](https://devfest.mn/) hosted by the [Google Developer Group Twin Cities](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-tc/). A deployed version of this demo can be found here: https://devfest2017-9088d.firebaseapp.com/

## Walkthrough
I believe there was a recording made of the demo. I'm not sure where it is, but I'm hoping it will be posted at some point and I'll be able to post it here for you to follow along and create your own version of this if you want!
